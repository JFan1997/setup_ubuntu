# Ubuntu Setup Script

This script automates the installation and configuration of essential tools and development environments on a fresh Ubuntu system. It sets up commonly used tools, configures Zsh with Oh My Zsh, installs Miniconda for Python environment management, Docker for containerization, and Visual Studio Code as a code editor.

## Features

- **Zsh**: Sets Zsh as the default shell and installs Oh My Zsh with the zsh-autosuggestions plugin.
- **Miniconda**: Installs Miniconda for Python package and environment management.
- **Docker**: Installs Docker for containerized application deployment and adds the current user to the Docker group for non-root usage.
- **Visual Studio Code**: Installs VS Code as the default code editor.
